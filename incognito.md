# Chrome Custom Tabs incognito setup

To enable incognito tabs you must set two flags in chrome:

[chrome://flags/#cct-incognito](chrome://flags/#cct-incognito)

[chrome://flags/#cct-incognito-available-to-third-party](chrome://flags/#cct-incognito-available-to-third-party)


-----

You will need to copy the above links and open them in Chrome as they cannot be directly linked

-----

Along with the the "incognito custom tabs" option in Sync under "Link Handling".

**Be warned this is a little buggy...**

Finally this only works with Chrome and not Firefox.
